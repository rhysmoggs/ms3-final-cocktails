Welcome to a new cocktail recipe website: The Cocktail Cabinet.

<h2 align="center"><img src="assets/readme-images/am-i-responsive.png"></h2>

The Cocktail Cabinet for the Milestone Project 3, for [Code Institute's](https://codeinstitute.net/) Diploma in Web App Development.

The Cocktail Cabinet is a passion project, with its idea birthed from the depths of a continious and a seemingly neverending lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic. Just like many others, the creator discovered a range of hobbies and projects ranging from the wholesome, worthwhile to the downright forgettable (or wish to forget?). Some of those interests stuck around and become a part of everyday normality, others were left behind and to be stowed away to never be spoken about again. Thankfully, cocktail making and drinking (responsibly) remained. The creator has a desire to share that love with a greater audience: those new to cocktails, other like-minded people, creative minds and curious tipple chasers - all are welcome to discover, share and enjoy! The creator is excited to launch The Cocktail Cabinet and hope to attract more and more cocktail lovers from across the world.

The website is a full stack project that covers backend and frontend, ...etc

### Project Goals:

The main brief for this project is to showcase the CRUD featuresa of both a relational and a non-relational database management ssytem. The goal is to combine a conventional relational database (postgreSQL) and a non-relational database (mongodb) and to allow them to work seemlessly together, with the ability to link both databases with no impact on the user experience. By combining both, the project can serve multiple approches to database management and CRUD functionality.

### Website Concept:

A website open to all above the age of 18 (due to drinking age). The The Cocktail Cabinet is a fully interactive and social website, with it's purpose to find, share and enjoy cocktail and mocktail recipes.

The website will clearly display information for new and returning customers including the creators contact information via social media links. The website is fully responsible on a range of devices - from hand-held devices to larger screens such as monitors and even TVs. This is to ensure that as many people as possible can visit the website.

The website is welcoming to a range of visitors, and gives a very nice user experience with plenty of on-screen prompts (explained here[Features](#features)) on dispaly and a whole host of fancy tech working in the background to ensure a smooth and easy experince.

The quiz generates 1 question at a time, with 4 multiple choice options as answers.
The player clicks on the buttons/answers and the quiz gives a visual prompt via the colour change to signify the players selection is correct (gold) or incorrect (red).
The quiz automatically displays the next question after a short delay.
There are a total of 10 questions to answer.
The end screen for the quiz gives the total amount of 'miles travelled'.
A player can enter their name to save their high score to the High Scores list.

## Data Schema Design
Here is the database schema layout for The Cocktail Cabinet website. It shows each collection, what data is kept, their type and how they are linked together.

<img src="wireframes/data-schema.png">

This schema is vital in developing the website's functionality, it's features and what all users are capable of doing. A breakdown of every feature can be found here [Features]() along with the code, and how everything links together.

The models.py file [link or screenshot ]holds the postgres side of things (list data and purpose), and the mongodb (give more info) holds the rest. A full setup can be found here [Development?](link) These can be adjusted for future projects or an adjustment to this one by:

explain steps. for admin. developer/creator and for end-user




## Aesthetic Design
Once the user goals and the projects intentions were set out, the next step was to design the aesthetic aspects of the The Cocktail Cabinet.



show flow of website, what page links to where etc


### Wireframes
Wireframes were drawn using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) at the beginning of the project. They were referenced throughout the design and building of the website. Following are a series of images showing the The Cocktail Cabinet on the three main screen sizes: desktop, tablet and mobile. Every major section of the website is also included.

### Colour Palette
- The colour palette leans towards a darker range of shades and colours in an effort to evoke a cool, mysterious mood - inspired  by some of the cocktail bars the creator has visited. This contrasted well with what is predicted to be a faily vast range of imagery chosen by the users - with cocktails covering every colour imaginable, often vibrant and bright. The main background hero image (bg.jpg) provides an array of browns, yellows, black and some shaded/darker colours.
- The heading and the game container use the same colour (rgba(230,236,240)), with a slight opacity for the container, allowing the background image to be seen, but not interfere too much with the flow and visibility of the quiz/content.
- By default, all buttons have a colour of "cultured/ whitesmoke" (rgb(239, 239, 239)) and that simplicity allows other colours and content to shine.
- The text colour is mostly white (rgb(255,255,255)) for the website's footer and navbar and also when placed upon hero images and cocktail imagery. This ensures a constant and obvious contrast between text and any background content or colours. When the background is much lighter, the text is black (rgb(0,0,0)), again to ensure clarity and readability.
- Some shadows to texts and containers are used to help with depth and contast.

<img src="assets/readme-images/palette.png">

- It was decided early on in the design stage that the gold (cyber yellow) colour would be important for the website. Some of the other colours were chosen around having this colour in mind, especially to ensure the colour was a focal point - always drawing the user's eyes to it and never obstructed or poorly contrasted by other colours. Therefore, the black font colour and the container and button colours provided the perfect colours to balance this. These combinations helped highlight the importance of providing a visually appealing quiz but also with high contrast and readability a priority.

- Here is the [Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) tool used to support this:

<img src="assets/readme-images/contrast.png">



### Images
- The use of photography is vital in creating allure and desire, especially for cocktail recipe website. Users are drawn by what they see. The bg.jpg background image is large and provides a fantastic colour to build an interface on.

- It's vital for the theme to be clear and obvious. The background image makes the website recognizable and memorable so people recall and return to it, which will draw more eyes to the website. This, along with the CSS styling and colour palette solidifies the theme. The following image was used.

<img src="assets/readme-images/bg.jpg">

Logo

<img src="assets/images/logo.png">

### Font
-  The The Cocktail Cabinet uses the Poppins font. It provides that clean, clear style without compromising on readability - a vital design feature for any website. This is available for free via [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and imported via CSS. Sans Serif is used as a secondary option in case of failure to import the font into the website correctly. Poppins is a clean font used frequently in designs, so it is both attractive and appropriate.

## Accessibility
Extremely important aspect.
-   Semantic design.
-   The use of alt to describe images and other content.
-   Aria-labelledby to link sections.
-   Colour and contrast considerations and testing.
-   Adding labels to forms.
-   Prompts to help guide users.

## Features

-   Responsive on all device sizes - from 320px upwards to larger desktops reaching 1200px and more.

Here are the 3 mains sections of the quiz:

### - The main menu

<img src="assets/readme-images/main-menu.png">

### - The quiz area

<img src="assets/readme-images/quiz.png">

### - The end screen

<img src="assets/readme-images/end-screen.png">

## Interactive Elements

-   Following is a list of all interactive elements of the The Cocktail Cabinet.

#### Quiz Logo

As shown on the images below, the quiz logo and title is very clear and bright. The centrepiece, always there and clickable. It shows off the quiz nicely, it's obviously related to geography and serves as a constant reminder to the user about where they are and what they are playing. The logo itself is a clickable link (a cursor appears when hovering over), and returns the user back to the home page at any time. 

<img src="assets/readme-images/logo-click.png">

```javascript
logoReload.addEventListener("click", reloadGame);

function reloadGame() {
    window.location.assign('index.html');
}
```

#### Toggle Menu Elements

Listed are the main features of the main menu of the quiz. The user simply clicks to show or hide the buttons to display info or return back to the main menu.

#### - How to Play

<img src="assets/readme-images/how-to-container.png">

```javascript
howToButton.onclick = function () {
    if (howToDiv.style.display !== "block") {
        howToDiv.style.display = "block";
        startButton.classList.add('hide');
        contactButton.classList.add('hide');
        highscoresButton.classList.add('hide');
    } else {
        howToDiv.style.display = "none";
        startButton.classList.remove('hide');
        contactButton.classList.remove('hide');
        highscoresButton.classList.remove('hide');
    }
};
```

#### - Contact

Each icon for the social media links turn gold when the user hovers over them to highlight the focused icon.

<img src="assets/readme-images/contact-container.png">
<img src="assets/readme-images/contact-container-hover.png">

```javascript
contactButton.onclick = function () {
    if (contactDiv.style.display !== "block") {
        contactDiv.style.display = "block";
        startButton.classList.add('hide');
        howToButton.classList.add('hide');
        highscoresButton.classList.add('hide');
    } else {
        contactDiv.style.display = "none";
        startButton.classList.remove('hide');
        howToButton.classList.remove('hide');
        highscoresButton.classList.remove('hide');
    }
};
```

The social media links on smaller screens (below 481px - such as mobile phones) have a more mobile-friendly layout.

<img src="assets/readme-images/mobile-social-links.jpg">

#### - High Scores

<img src="assets/readme-images/highscores-container.png">

````javascript
highscoresButton.onclick = function () {
    if (highscoresDiv.style.display !== "block") {
        highscoresDiv.style.display = "block";
        startButton.classList.add('hide');
        howToButton.classList.add('hide');
        contactButton.classList.add('hide');
    } else {
        highscoresDiv.style.display = "none";
        startButton.classList.remove('hide');
        howToButton.classList.remove('hide');
        contactButton.classList.remove('hide');
    }
};
````

#### Buttons

#### - General Buttons

- Almost every button is styled to look the same. A clean and clear button to make for user readability and speed, paramount to elite quizzing.

<img src="assets/readme-images/button.png">

- The colours simply invert when a cursor hovers over them. A simple visual indicator and keeping in line with the colour palette.

<img src="assets/readme-images/button-hover.png">

#### - High Scores Button

- The few exception to the rule is the High Scores button (and mention the disabled button). Due to the nature of this button and it's significance, it was decided to style this differently with a golden (#) hue/ . This is pure bragging rights and to entice the players to compete for the highest score. it will be big factor for returning players.

<img src="assets/readme-images/button-highscore.png">

#### - Save Button
- The Save button is set as disabled as a default. Once the user inputs their name, the button returns to a normal state, just like the others.

<img src="assets/readme-images/button-disabled.png">

#### - Correct Answer Button

- Gold (rgb(255,210,0)) indicates a correct answer.

<img src="assets/readme-images/button-correct.png">

#### - Incorrect Answer Button

- Red (rgb(255,0,0)) indicates an incorrect answer.

<img src="assets/readme-images/button-incorrect.png">

#### - Input

- The 'Enter your name' input field has a very basic style applied. IF the user chooses not to enter their name, then the Save button remains disabled and the user will not be able to save their score to the High Scores section.

<img src="assets/readme-images/input.png">

#### - Progress Bar

- The progress bar indicates the progress made by the user via the golden colour-fill and plane image. Every correct answer adds 10% to the progress bar - with the user's aim to reach 100%, a total of 10/10 correct answers and maximum score.

Here is the code that increments the score and allows the plane image to track the progress bar with each correct answer. This all happens simultaneously.

```javascript
if(classToApply === 'correct') {
    correctAnswers = (correctAnswers + 1);
    
    incrementScore(SCORE_POINTS);
    progressBarFull.style.width = `${correctAnswers * 10}%`;
    plane.style.left = "100%";
}
```

<img src="assets/readme-images/progressbar.png">


#### - API
The URL in the JS code below were preselected by the developer. The categories for the quiz are:
- Number of Questions - 10
- Category - Geography
- Difficulty - Easy
- Type - Multiple Choice
- Default Encoding

```javascript
fetch(
    'https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=10&category=22&difficulty=easy&type=multiple'
)
    .then((res) => {
        return res.json();
    })
```

## Testing Original User Stories

Following are the original [User Stories](#user-stories) set out in the early design stages of the project. They were individually tested to see if each goal was satisfied against the completed project.

#### As a New User :
* I want to to be able to access and play quiz on the device I'm using.
    - The quiz has been tested for ease of access and responsiveness on dozens of devices (handheld devices such as mobile phones and tablets, laptops, desktop computers and larger Samsung TVs) and is fully responsible from at least a minimum of 320px up to at least 1200px. See [here](#further-testing) for more testing related tasks.
* I want to to be able to play with ease.
    - Part of the biggest draw to quiz by nature is their simplicity and easy of use. The quiz is a click-and-play format and the interactive prompts and layout make it very clear to understand for any first-time user.
* I want to to be able to understand the quiz immediately.
    - The style and layout, along with the interactive features and prompts enable first-time users to understand the quiz, the theme and it's purpose.
* I want to to be able to access instructions if need be.
    - The How to Play [button](#how-to-play) is clear and obvious from the first screen the user is presented with. A minimal styling setup and only 4 buttons ensure that information is displayed clearly and to not overwhelm users. All instructions are found after clicking on this button.
* I want to to be able to contact the quiz developers if I wish to.
    - The Contact [button](#contact) is clear and obvious from the first screen the user is presented with. A minimal styling setup and only 4 buttons ensure that information is displayed clearly and to not overwhelm users. All contact information is found after clicking on this button.
* I want there to be plenty of variety.
    - Thanks to the API automatically generating questions from a deep database and also having the answers randomly ordered from the 4 possible choice-containers, the variety and quiz is never the same.

#### As a Returning User :
* I want to find information about the developer's background, their story and growth.
    - The Contact [button](#contact) provides links to all the developers social media [links](#contact) (twitter, YouTube, instagram and LinkedIn). The contact information can be found on those platforms. For example the developers contact information is on each profile of these social media websites, there are YouTube vlogs of the company's developing stage, snippets of inside-info on instagram and all professional history and access via LinkedIn.
* I want to find the best way to get in contact with the company with any questions I may have.
    - Once the Contact [button](#contact) is clicked., it provides links to all the developers social media links (twitter, YouTube, instagram and LinkedIn). The contact information can be found on those platforms and provides a quick and direct link to the users queries.
* I want to be able to contact the company in many different ways.
    - Once the Contact [button](#contact) is clicked, it gives access to 4 social media options the user can choose to contact the developer through.
* I want to be able to view my high scores.
    - Once the High Scores [button](#high-scores) is clicked, it gives access to the high scores list, with a maximum of 5 user names and scores capable of being displayed.
* I want to be able to save my score after the quiz.
    - After completing all 10 questions, the quiz displays the [end screen](#the-end-screen) to the user. Here, the user can choose to enter their name in the prompted [input field](#input) and the previously disabled Save [button](#save-button) is made clickable. If clicked, the user name is saved to the High Scores list if it made the top 5 high scores.
* I want to to be able to access and play the quiz on a range of devices/browsers.
    - The quiz has been tested for ease of access and responsiveness on dozens of devices (handheld devices such as mobile phones and tablets, laptops, desktop computers and larger Samsung TVs) and is fully responsible from at least a minimum of 320px up to at least 1200px. it also works on multiple browsers as stated [here](#further-testing).

## Google Chrome Lighthouse Test

Following are the Google Chrome Lighthouse results for each page.

- Main menu and quiz area/ index.html

<img src="assets/readme-images/lighthouse-index.png">

- End page / end.html

<img src="assets/readme-images/lighthouse-end.png">

### Testing Quiz Flow and Functionality

All of the following tests were repeated multiple times to ensure a fair test. The same tests were then repeated multiple times on different browsers (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge and Opera) and then finally the same tests were repeated again on multiple occasions and for different devices (mobile phones, tablets, laptops and larger screen sizes).

#### - Main Menu Test
<img src="assets/readme-images/main-menu-test.png">

#### - Quiz Area Test
<img src="assets/readme-images/quiz-area-test.png">
<img src="assets/readme-images/quiz-area-test2.png">

#### - End Screen Test
<img src="assets/readme-images/end-screen-test.png">

### Further Testing

-   Testing was predominantly made using Google Chrome's own developer tools and 'Inspect Mode', although testing was done sporadically on alternative browsers with each major addition to the quiz e.g new content, style updates and responsive changes via media queries.
-   Console.log() function was used for JavaScript code development.
-   All interactive elements of the quiz were tested. Button functions, clicking, hiding/showing content, user input, links and general flow of quiz. Bugs were fixed as they arose.
-   The quiz was tested on Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge and Opera browsers and ran efficiently on each one. There were slight stylistic differences when testing between browsers, but these were resolved afterwards. See below for an example when testing on the Opera browser:
<img src="assets/readme-images/opera-test.png">
To resolve this, the background-colour was specified in the style.css file, instead of allowing the browsers default styling/button colours decide. This encouraged further testing and ensuring that all important style factors were specified.
-   The quiz was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPad & iPhoneX.
-   Feedback from friends and family, testing the quiz with no prior instruction or expectations. Adjustments were made if necessary to satisfy the [User Targets](#as-a-new-user).

### Bug Fixes
Bug fixes were predominantly completed in real-time as soon as any issues arose. This was to ensure the project would continue developing smoothly without serious, unmanageable bugs arising later that could drastically reduce development time or the layout and functioning of the quiz.

-   As seen from the style.css file, there is a lot of custom CSS. Media queries were used at different breakpoints - although time consuming, it was vital to invest time into this to ensure the quiz was functioning correctly on various displays to ensure a major [User Targets](#as-a-new-user) was met. Some JavaScript tweaks were also implemented to alter the class width at different stages of the quiz e.g. the main menu, quiz itself or the end.

-   Placed a background-colour behind the score for readability purposes as a Lighthouse test had brought up contrast issues between the gold text colour and the lighter background.

-   Added rel-"noopener" to external links opening in new tabs for security purposes.

### Known Bugs

-   The background image (maps.jpg) repeats slightly towards the very bottom of the Surface Pro 7 (912px x 1368px) device. It can also do this on larger TVs or wide-display devices such as tablets.

### Future Updates

There are many planned updates arranged for the The Cocktail Cabinet that include but are not limited to:

-   Introduction of difficulty level choices i.e. Easy, Normal, Hard.
-   Introduction of images, linked to the questions.
-   Sound effects and music.
-   More questions.
-   Theme/colour palette toggle.
-   Timer to add more difficulty.

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages
The following instructions are taken from Code Institutes [README.md template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/SampleREADME/blob/master/README.md)

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page), locate the "Settings" Button on the menu.
    - Alternatively Click [Here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/) for a GIF demonstrating the process starting from Step 2.
3. Scroll down the Settings page until you locate the "GitHub Pages" Section.
4. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch".
5. The page will automatically refresh.
6. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site [link](https://github.com) in the "GitHub Pages" section.

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.

## Credits

### Code
-   At the early stages of the development, the [How to Make a Quiz App using HTML CSS Javascript - Vanilla Javascript Project for Beginners Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4fB9Xg2JEY&list=FLoLMoJL7IfiYl8F3sN_CEqQ&index=16) tutorial was followed and the code was used as the basis of the quiz. Supporting GitHub code [here](https://github.com/briancodex/quiz-app-js). Original code was later added alongside that found in the YouTube video to suit the quiz. Code tweaks were made to suit this quiz, pre-determined code edited or removed along with adjustments and restyling to the majority of the CSS found in the credited video. Upon further searching, it seems that [Build a Quiz App - Intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u98ROZjBWy8&list=PLDlWc9AfQBfZIkdVaOQXi1tizJeNJipEx) and that playlist of videos may be what that YouTube video was also inspired by.

-   'Web Dev Simplified' YouTube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riDzcEQbX6k&list=FLoLMoJL7IfiYl8F3sN_CEqQ&index=13) was also used and combined with the above videos to help shape the The Cocktail Cabinet. Supporting GitHub code [here](https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/JavaScript-Quiz-App).

-   The API aspect of the quiz was introduced thanks to the [Build a Quiz App (11) - Fetch API to Load Questions API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aKOQn2NPFs&list=PLDlWc9AfQBfZIkdVaOQXi1tizJeNJipEx&index=12) tutorial, to which edits were then made. Supporting link to GitHub [here](https://github.com/jamesqquick/Build-A-Quiz-App-With-HTML-CSS-and-JavaScript).

-   The ability to toggle (show and hide) content via the How To Play, Contact and High Scores buttons on the main menu screen came from W3Schools documentation found [here](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_toggle_hide_show.asp), and a separate source [here](https://sebhastian.com/javascript-show-hide-div-onclick-toggle/) which was then edited to suit the project, along with additional customization.

-   This README.md document was based on Code Institutes [SampleREADME](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/SampleREADME/blob/master/README.md). The template was used as a guide, then filled with content related to this website. The MS2 Quiz [README.md](https://github.com/rhysmoggs/ms2-quiz/blob/main/README.md) file - the developers personal MS2 submission for the Code Institute course - was also used and then edited to suit this project.

Data Schema:

link both together through...


- Relational Database:


    PostgreSQL - open-source, Object-Relational Databse Management System (ORDBMS). fre use, licencing? good for future projects or launching this one if needs be.

    primary key - A unique ID that identifies individual records regardless of any changes that occur



- Non-Relational Database:
    mongoDB - 

------



deployment of website:

1. If you wish to - use Code Institute's template from here:  / copy this projects link/url?
2. install two python packages. Flask and SQLAlchemy to work with Postgres databases. psycopg2 is necessary to work with Postgres database. In command line type: `pip3 install Flask-SQLAlchemy psycopg2`
3. create "env.py" file
4. Create a ".gitignore" file if you choose not to use Code Institute's template. Add `env.py` and the soon to be generated `__pyache__/` to it. All hidden and sensitive files/folders to be added here.
5. in "env.py", type following:
    ```
    import os

    os.environ.setdefault("IP", "0.0.0.0")
    os.environ.setdefault("PORT", "5000")
    os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "any_secret_key")
    os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
    os.environ.setdefault("DEVELOPMENT", "True")
    os.environ.setdefault("DB_URL", "postgresql:///<DATABASE>")
    ```

    The `any_secret_key` can be called whatever you wish: `os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "any_secret_key")`or generate a random and secure password here: https://randomkeygen.com/

    make sure to change `os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")` to "False" before deploying/launching project.

    `<DATABASE>` points to the databse to be created, in this case "my_cocktails".
6. create a folder (in this case, folder is named "cocktails") in the root of your project.
7. within that newly created folder, create a file called `__init__.py`
8. write the following in the new file:
    ```
    import os
    from flask import Flask
    from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
    if os.path.exists("env.py"):
        import env  # noqa


    app = Flask(__name__)
    app.config["SECRET_KEY"] = os.environ.get("SECRET_KEY")
    app.config["SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI"] = os.environ.get("DB_URL")

    db = SQLAlchemy(app)

    from cocktails import routes  # noqa
    ```
9. create a "routes.py" file within the "cocktails" folder
10. within that "routes.py" file, write the following:
    ```
    from flask import render_template
    from cocktails import app, db


    @app.route("/")
    def home():
        return render_template("base.html")
    ```
11. in root of project, create "run.py" file
12. within "run.py", write the following:
    ```
    import os
    from cocktails import app


    if __name__ == "__main__":
        app.run(
            host=os.environ.get("IP"),
            port=int(os.environ.get("PORT")),
            debug=os.environ.get("DEBUG")
        )
    ```
13. within "cocktails" folder, create a new "templates" folder. This is where Flask will search for any html templates to be rendered.
14. create a new file "base.html" within the "templates" folder.
15. within the "base.html" file, write whatever you wish to be presented on your website.
16. in the terminal, write `python3 run.py` to launch the project.
17. add, commit and push.


Setting up Databse - postgreSQL database:

make sure you have postgreSQL installed locally if you are not using CI's template?
set up the databse schema as follows:
1. define our models by creating a "models.py" file within the "cocktails" folders
2. write the following in the "models.py" file and create the tables:
    ```
    from cocktails import db


    class Category(db.Model):
        # schema for the Category model
        id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
        category_name = db.Column(db.String(25), unique=True, nullable=False)

        def __repr__(self):
            # __repr__ to represent itself in the form of a string
            return self.category_name


    class Users(db.Model):
        # schema for the Users model
        id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
        user_name = db.Column(db.String(20), unique=True, nullable=False)
        password = db.Column(db.String(260), nullable=False)

        def __repr__(self):
            # __repr__ to represent itself in the form of a string
            return self.user_name
    ```
3. in "routes.py", import these newly created models:
    ```
    from cocktails.models import Category, Users
    ```
4. log in to postgreSQL terminal by typing psql in terminal.
5. type `CREATE DATABASE cocktails;`
6. then `\c cocktails;` to connect to the newly created database.
7. finally `\q` to exit.
8. use python to generate and migrate the models into the database. if any changes are made to this database, you must repeat the same steps to refresh and update your database. in the terminal, type `python3`.
9. type `from cocktails import db`
10. type `db.create_all()`
11. if you wish to check that the tables exist, type `psql -d cocktails` followed by `\dt` then `\q` to quit, otherwise just exit via `exit()`.
12. commit then push


Setting up Database - MongoDB database:

Make sure to that you have a MongoDB account.

1. Create a cluster (https://www.mongodb.com/basics/clusters/mongodb-cluster-setup). This project uses a shared cluster. Choose the closest region to you which is free to use. Free cluster tier and then name your `<CLUSTER>` ("myFirstCluster", in this project).
2. In Database Access, add a new database user (https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/security-add-mongodb-users/#add-database-users).
3. In Network Access, click add IP address and choose 'Allow Access From Anywhere'. Input the IP of your hosts here to add further security.
4. In the newly created `<CLUSTER>`, click on Create a Database and under Database Name, enter a `<DATABASE>` name, ("my_cocktails", in this project)
5. Under collection name, enter `<COLLECTION>` ("cocktails", in this project).
6. Within the `<DATABASE>` ("my_cocktails"), click on Create Collection button and enter any other collections you wish to store.
7. Within each collection, click on Insert Document, and enter the key-value pairs you wish to store in your document. For this project, the following key names and value data types were stored:
    ```
    _id: <ObjectId>
    cocktail_name: <string>
    category_name: <string>
    cocktail_img: <string>
    cocktail_description: <string>
    created_by: <string>
    main_ingredient: <string>
    method: <string>
    other_ingredients: <array>
    prep_time: <Int32> with a default value of "0"
    servings: <Int32> with a default value of "0"
    ```
8. In the terminal, install dnspython `pip3 install dnspython`
9. Install pymongo too `pip3 install flask-pymongo`
10. on the mongo website, in your collection, connect your cluster. Choose 'Connect your application' and choose Python and your version (3.6 or later, in this project).
11. Copy the connection string.
12. In the "env.py" file, add the following environment variables to the already present ones:
    ```
    os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_URI", "mongodb+srv://<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@<CLUSTER>.1megs.mongodb.net/<DATABASE>?retryWrites=true&w=majority")
    os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_DBNAME", "<DATABASE>")
    ```
    Make sure to insert your own information for `<USERNAME>`, `<PASSWORD>`, `<CLUSTER>` and `<DATABASE>`.
13. In "__init__.py" add  `from flask_pymongo import PyMongo`.
14. Add and update:
    ```
    app.config["MONGO_DBNAME"] = os.environ.get("MONGO_DBNAME")
    app.config["MONGO_URI"] = os.environ.get("MONGO_URI")

    mongo = PyMongo(app)
    ```
15. In "routes.py", update entire file to be:
    ```
    from flask import (
        flash, render_template,
        request, redirect, session, url_for)
    from bson.objectid import ObjectId
    from cocktails import app, db, mongo
    from cocktails.models import Category, Users


    @app.route("/")
    def home():
        return render_template("cocktails.html")
    ```
16. In terminal, write `touch cocktails/templates/cocktails.html`
17. In "cocktails.html" add your website content here (use templates and link "base.html" to all other pages etc)
18. In terminal, "python3 run.py" to view your work.
19. add, commit, push.


Linking the databases:

1. Using category_id
2. 


Deploy the application to Heroku:

1. Create a "requirements.txt" by typing `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt` in the terminal. This lists what is necessary to run the project.
2. Create a Procfile by typing `echo web: python run.py > Procfile` in the terminal. In the newly created "Procfile", check to see if a blank line appears under the written code. If there is, delete and save that change. It can cause issues with Heroku.
3. Commit and push.
4. On the Heroku website. Create a new app and name it. Choose the regeion closest to you.
5. Create a new database on Heroku. Resources > Add-ons, search for heroku postgres and choose the 'Hobby Dev - Free' option, or whichever suits your needs.
6. Once confirmed, go to Settings > Config Vars > Reveal Config Vars, and input the following:
    ```
    IP = 0.0.0.0
    PORT = 5000
    SECRET_KEY = your_secret_key_here
    MONGO_URI = mongodb+srv://<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@<CLUSTER>.1megs.mongodb.net/<DATABASE>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
    MONGO_DBNAME = your_database_name_here
    ```
    You can add:
    ```
    DEBUG = True
    ```
    temporarily but make sure to change to `False` when finalizing the app. Keep to `True` for error fixing during development.
7. In your Config Vars in Heroku, if DATABASE_URL starts with `postgres` instead of `postgresql`, update your `__init__.py` file to:
```
import os
import re
from flask import Flask
from flask_pymongo import PyMongo
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
if os.path.exists("env.py"):
    import env  # noqa


app = Flask(__name__)
app.config["SECRET_KEY"] = os.environ.get("SECRET_KEY")
app.config["MONGO_DBNAME"] = os.environ.get("MONGO_DBNAME")
app.config["MONGO_URI"] = os.environ.get("MONGO_URI")

uri = os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL")
if uri.startswith("postgres://"):
    uri = uri.replace("postgres://", "postgresql://", 1)
app.config["SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI"] = uri  # heroku

db = SQLAlchemy(app)
mongo = PyMongo(app)

from cocktails import routes  # noqa
```
This wil ensure that the database is correctly linked.
8. In github, make sure you've added, commited and pushed your latest work.
9. The following point is an extract taken from Code Institute:

    ```Automated Deployments from GitHub disabled by Heroku
    Due to a security issue, Heroku has disabled automated deployments from GitHub. Unfortunately, we have no indication if or when they will reactivate this. In order for you to deploy while this situation persists, please follow the steps below to deploy from your Gitpod workspace:

    - Open the terminal.
    - For those of you who are using MFA/2FA: please scroll down to see the additional steps required.
    For those of you not using MFA/2FA: Log in to Heroku and enter your details.
    command: heroku login -i
    - Get your app name from heroku.
    command: heroku apps
    - Set the heroku remote. (Replace <app_name> with your actual app name and remove the <> characters)
    command: heroku git:remote -a <app_name>
    - Add and commit any changes to your code if applicable
    command: git add . && git commit -m "Deploy to Heroku via CLI"
    - Push to both GitHub and Heroku
    command: git push origin main
    command: git push heroku main

    MFA/2FA enabled?
    - Click on Account Settings (under the avatar menu) on the Heroku Dashboard.
    - Scroll down to the API Key section and click Reveal. Copy the key.
    - Back in your Gitpod workspace, enter the command: heroku_config , and enter your API key you copied when prompted.
    - Continue from step 3 above. If you get prompted to log in at any point:
      - Enter your Heroku username.
      - Enter the API key you just copied.
    
    Need to deploy again?
    You should just be able to add, commit and push, and if prompted enter your username and API key again.

10. Click 'Open App' in heroku, and your project will be displayed here.
11. Due to the automatic deployment issues on heroku's part, any changes to your app will need to manually be updated by following step 8. again.
12. We need to create our tables on the Heroku database. In Heroku, on the top-right, clcik More > Run Console.
13. Type `python3`
14. Type `from cocktails import db` then `db.create_all()` then `exit()`
15. In GitHub, change your `env.py` to reflet the newly created database by deleting `os.environ.setdefault("DB_URL", "postgresql:///cocktails")` and inserting `os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "<heroku string>")` from Heroku's config vars.
